## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Add the card to your Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:battery-runtime-calculator
battery_entity: sensor.battery_level
power_entity: sensor.home_power_consumption
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:battery-runtime-calculator
name: "House Battery Status"
battery_entity: sensor.battery_level
power_entity: sensor.home_power_consumption
generation_entity: sensor.solar_power  # Optional: for charge time calculation
grid_charging_entity: sensor.grid_power  # Optional: for grid charging
battery_charging_entity: sensor.battery_charge_power  # Optional: for accurate charging detection
battery_discharging_entity: sensor.battery_discharge_power  # Optional: for accurate charging detection
battery_capacity: 13.5  # kWh (if not available in entity attributes)
show_power: true
show_capacity: true
show_runtime: true
show_charge_time: true
update_interval: 30  # seconds
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `battery_entity` | string | **Required** | Entity ID for battery level (percentage) |
| `power_entity` | string | **Required** | Entity ID for power consumption (watts) |
| `generation_entity` | string | optional | Entity ID for solar generation (watts) |
| `grid_charging_entity` | string | optional | Entity ID for grid charging power (watts) |
| `battery_power_entity` | string | optional | Entity ID for battery power flow (positive=discharge, negative=charge) |
| `battery_charging_entity` | string | optional | Entity ID for battery charging power (watts) |
| `battery_discharging_entity` | string | optional | Entity ID for battery discharging power (watts) |
| `name` | string | "House Battery" | Card title |
| `battery_capacity` | number | auto-detect | Battery capacity in kWh |
| `show_power` | boolean | true | Show power consumption |
| `show_capacity` | boolean | true | Show battery capacity |
| `show_runtime` | boolean | true | Show estimated runtime |
| `show_charge_time` | boolean | true | Show charge time remaining |
| `update_interval` | number | 30 | Update interval in seconds |

## Required Entities

### Battery Entity
Your battery level entity should provide:
- **State**: Battery percentage (0-100)
- **Attributes** (optional): `capacity` or `battery_capacity` in kWh

Example entities:
- `sensor.battery_level`
- `sensor.battery_percentage`
- `sensor.solar_battery_level`

### Power Entity
Your power consumption entity should provide:
- **State**: Power consumption in watts (positive value)

Example entities:
- `sensor.home_power_consumption`
- `sensor.total_power_usage`
- `sensor.grid_power_consumption`

## How It Works

The card calculates runtime using this formula:

```
Runtime (hours) = (Battery Level % / 100) √ó Battery Capacity (kWh) / Power Consumption (kW)
```

### Example Calculation

- Battery Level: 75%
- Battery Capacity: 13.5 kWh
- Power Consumption: 2.5 kW

```
Runtime = (75 / 100) √ó 13.5 / 2.5 = 4.05 hours = 4h 3m
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Battery capacity not configured" Error

This means the card can't determine your battery capacity. Solutions:

1. **Check entity attributes**: Look at your battery entity in Developer Tools ‚Üí States
2. **Manual configuration**: Add `battery_capacity: 13.5` to your card config
3. **Update integration**: Some battery integrations don't expose capacity

### "No power consumption data" Error

This means your power entity isn't providing valid data. Solutions:

1. **Check entity state**: Ensure it shows a positive number in watts
2. **Verify entity ID**: Make sure the entity exists and is spelled correctly
3. **Check units**: The entity should report watts, not kilowatts

### Runtime Shows 0 or Very Low

Possible causes:
1. **High power consumption**: Your home is using more power than expected
2. **Low battery level**: Battery is nearly empty
3. **Incorrect capacity**: Battery capacity might be set too low
4. **Wrong power entity**: You might be monitoring the wrong power sensor

## Customization

### Styling

The card uses Home Assistant's CSS variables for theming. It will automatically adapt to:
- Light/dark themes
- Custom themes
- High contrast mode

### Advanced Styling

You can override styles by adding custom CSS to your theme:

```yaml
# In your theme file
card-mod-battery-runtime-calculator:
  --battery-color-low: "#ff4444"
  --battery-color-medium: "#ffaa00"
  --battery-color-high: "#44ff44"
```
